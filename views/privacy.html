    <p>
      We strive to protect information security of the users to avoid any
      information leakage, loss, improper usage, unauthorized access and

      protection solutions, management system controlling, security system

      measures we take include but not limited to firewall, encryption (such as
      SSL), de-identification or anonymization, access controlling, etc.
      Further, we will constantly strengthen the security capacity of the
      software installed in your devices. For example, we will implement part of
      the encryption work in your devices locally to consolidate a secured
      transmission; we will collect the information of the applications
      installed in your devices and its processing information during operation
      to avoid malicious programs such as virus and Trojan.

    <p> </p>
    <p>
      We have established special management regulations, procedures and
      organizations to safeguard the security of the personal information we
      collected. For example, we will apply strict limitation on the scope of
      people authorized to access the information, requiring them to obey
      confidential obligations and conducting audits. Those who violates such
      obligations will be punished in accordance with the regulations. We will
      also review the management regulations, procedures and organizations to
      prevent unauthorized access, use or disclosure of the users’ information
      by those people that are without authorization.

      We suggest you give full attention to the protection of personal
      information when using the products and services, and we will also provide

    <p>
      As a general rule, we retain your personal information only as long as
      required to perform the Services or other purpose that was the reason for
      the collection of the information. We will retain most of your personal
      information as long as you use the Services (i.e., until account deletion
      in accordance with your request) with the following exceptions: Contact
      Information that is obtained as a result of you participating in our
      promotional activities will be retained during such activities as

      account and/or the Services you use from us for as long as you have an
      active account with us. We will take reasonable measures to delete this
      personal information if you delete your account. However, you acknowledge
      that we will keep certain records (e.g., personal information relating to
      payments or customer service matters) where we need (and have rights) to,
      such as for legal or accounting purposes. We’ll also keep information in
      order to exercise, defend, or establish our rights.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>
      In the event that the processing and retention period have terminated, but
      personal information is required to be retained continuously for other
      reasons including for archiving purposes as prescribed under applicable
      laws, the relevant personal information will be stored and maintained
      separately from other types of personal information. If you require us to
      destroy your personal information before the end of its life cycle (as set
      out in the retention policy above), we will destroy your personal
      information in accordance with local laws).

      processed by us.

      personal information (as described below) while we consider your request.

      under data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defense of legal
      claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the
      case. Where you have requested that we erase personal information that has
      been made available publicly on the Services and there are grounds for
      erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that are
      displaying the personal information or providing links to the personal
      information to erase it too.

      <strong>9.Protection of Minors</strong>
    </p>

      <strong
        >We attach great importance to the protection of minors’ personal
        information, and we will keep exploring new ways to protect minors’
        personal information.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >We will protect the legitimate rights and interests of minors by
        initiating anti-addiction system in accordance with relevant regulations
        on online game anti-addiction policies. We will make a judgment on
        whether the real name information of an account belongs to a minor via
        the identification result of information such as real-name identity,
        based on which we decide whether the account shall be included in the
        anti-addiction system. In addition, we will collect information such as
        your login time, length of playing games, etc., and guide the minors to
        play games rationally through ways such as automatically intervening and
        limiting the game duration of the minors in our system, enabling
        the function of mandatorily exiting the game, etc. When the consumption
        is conducted by a person suspected to be a minor, we will then try to
        contact his or her parent or legal guardian for reminders, confirmations
        and deposition, so as to help the minors have a healthy access to the
        Internet.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >At the same time, in order to better protect both the physical and
        mental health of minors and facilitate a healthy access to the Internet
        for them, we may employ stricter anti-addiction measures on the basis of
        relevant anti-addiction policies related to online games. Further, we
        will keep conducting researches and testing various technologies to
        protect the minors. For example, in order to further improve the
        accuracy of real-name verification on identities and to try best to
        prevent minors from impersonating the identity of others, we may enable
        face-recognition verifications in some games or for some users (subject
        to specific game strategies) under specific situations (for example,
        when you log into a game, or when you top up, purchase or make
        transactions during the game).</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Besides, we may also collect your game behavior data generated during
        the game (for example, the data such as the click pressure and radius,
        the relative position of the click, the acceleration direction, and the
        direction of gravity formed when you operate the game on the terminal
        device, and the voice data generated when you interact with other
        players through online voice in the game) to preliminarily determine
        whether the user is a minor (regarding the voice data, the system will
        only randomly use some of your online voice to judge whether it is from
        a child or an adult). If the preliminary determination shows you are a
        minor, we may enable the face-recognition verification in accordance
        with the foregoing prescriptions.</strong
